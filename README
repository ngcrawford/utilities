This repository contains general unix utilities written by Nicholas Crawford.

Currently it only contains one script, pybmig.py, that will accept bsub -l output and automatically kill and resubmit stalled jobs.  It is possible to set the amount of time required to determine if a job has hung.  More details may be obtained by typing pybmig.py --help at the command prompt.
